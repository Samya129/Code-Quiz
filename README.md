# Code-Quiz

  As a student, I wanted to create a quiz using Javascript and its fundamentals to store high scores. I wanted to be sure that the following was present:

  -When the start button is clicked, a timer starts and a question appears that prompts an answer with follow-up questions. 
  
  -When the user gets a question incorrect, time is deducted from the time they have remaining to complete the quiz. 
  
  -When all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 then the quiz is over. 
  
  -When the quiz is over, the user is able to save their initials and score for what they got on their quiz.

Applications used:

  -Javascript
  
  -CSS
  
  -HTML
